**Material for [ZhiHu post](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/27439184) that describes end-to-end self driving car.**

Use Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to train an end-to-end self driving system in a [simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim).

- drive.py: script for applying model in self-driving.
`python drive.py model.h5`
- model.py: code for training the model. Data needs to be collected in the simulator for starting the training.
- model.h5: a well trained model using data I collected for scene 1.
- self-driving.mp4: the result video for scene 1.
